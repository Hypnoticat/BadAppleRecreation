To run get ImageMagick and compile reading.cpp  
Then pass this binary a video file that it will break down into frame data  
Compile bad.cpp with Canvas.h and Circle.h to create the final binary  

Start up a python server with `python3 -m http.server`  
Open a browser(prefereably chrome) and go to `localhost:8000`  
Then run the final binary and see your video file recreated with small circles  

The motivation for this project was simply to recreate a video display within the limitation of the files provided
